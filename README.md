# develop-SolarCOD
The goal of this project is to use solar energy to power data base energy batteries.
Technology advances on a daily basis, and while we have limited energy resources, we have unlimited energy demands.
This website aims to provide both resources in one place.
There are a finite number of resources, yet there is no finite amount of energy.
The battery life is limited, but the data is not.
